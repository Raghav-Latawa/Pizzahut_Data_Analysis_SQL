## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
How many total orders were placed?
What is the total revenue generated from pizza sales?
Which pizza has the highest price?
What is the most common pizza size ordered?
What are the top 5 most ordered pizza types by quantity?
What is the total quantity of pizzas ordered by category?
How are orders distributed by hour of the day?
How many pizzas exist in each category?
What is the average number of pizzas ordered per day?
What are the top 3 pizza types by total revenue?
What percentage of total revenue does each pizza type contribute?
How does revenue accumulate over time (cumulative revenue by date)?
What are the top 3 pizza types by revenue within each category?

Git – For version control and tracking project changes.

GitHub – To host and share code, queries, visualizations, and documentation.

Excel / Google Sheets – For initial data cleaning, exploration, and CSV inspection.

Matplotlib – To create visualizations such as line plots and bar charts.

Seaborn – For statistical and aesthetically enhanced visualizations.
