# INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on analyzing a pizza sales dataset to uncover key business insights using SQL and data visualization tools. The dataset consists of four CSV files: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types, each containing crucial information about sales transactions, pizza types, pricing, and order metadata.

The main goals of the analysis are to:

Understand overall sales performance.

Identify top-selling pizzas and categories.

Analyze order trends by time and day.

Determine revenue distribution across different pizza types and sizes.

To achieve these goals, I used MySQL for data querying, Excel/Google Sheets for initial exploration, and Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the results. Git and GitHub were used for version control and documentation throughout the project.

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
How many total orders were placed?
What is the total revenue generated from pizza sales?
Which pizza has the highest price?
What is the most common pizza size ordered?
What are the top 5 most ordered pizza types by quantity?
What is the total quantity of pizzas ordered by category?
How are orders distributed by hour of the day?
How many pizzas exist in each category?
What is the average number of pizzas ordered per day?
What are the top 3 pizza types by total revenue?
What percentage of total revenue does each pizza type contribute?
How does revenue accumulate over time (cumulative revenue by date)?
What are the top 3 pizza types by revenue within each category?


# Tools I Used
MySQL – For storing and querying data using SQL.

SQL – To perform data analysis with joins, aggregations, filters, and subqueries.

Git – For version control and tracking project changes.

GitHub – To host and share code, queries, visualizations, and documentation.

Excel / Google Sheets – For initial data cleaning, exploration, and CSV inspection.

Matplotlib – To create visualizations such as line plots and bar charts.

Seaborn – For statistical and aesthetically enhanced visualizations.
